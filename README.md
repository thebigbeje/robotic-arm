This paper aims to present a cost effective and efficient robotic arm solution capable of helping disabled people. By utilizing the latest technologies such as 3D printing and futuristic robotics, this robotic arm will be able to perform a variety of tasks with precision and  accuracy.

It will be capable of performing tasks such as picking up and manipulating objects, writing, and even providing a sense of touch for users. The cost-effectiveness of the solution comes from the use of off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts that can be produced at a fraction of the cost of traditional robots.

Furthermore, the robotâ€™s design is simple to understand and operate so it can be used by people with limited technical skills. This paper will discuss the design principles behind this robotic arm, its components, its capabilities, and provide an overview of its cost effectiveness in comparison to other robotics solutions. Finally, it will discuss how this robot can benefit disabled individuals by providing them with greater independence and improved quality of life
